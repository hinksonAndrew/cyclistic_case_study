# Cyclistic Case Study
## Google Data Analytics Certificate
I am doing an analysis for a fictitious company named Cyclistic but using data from Divvy a bike share company based in Chicago, Illinois for the year 2023. I got the data from https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html under this license https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement
* I also have a google slides presentation for this project located here 
[my google slide show](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTtKp3O9r1-blmMNVPyWy32rfsWA2NxB-2UgAct4anHn48oSrUpcFaZHo4cz3rzQdW0HMuNNe0nZ30p/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

### Objective
How do annual and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

With an in depth analysis of bike rentals for the year 2023, we can determine the different ways that annual and casual riders use our bikes. This will allow our marketing team to develop different campaigns that target our casual members and convert them to annual members.

### Visualizations
Visualization of the number of rides by rider type each weekday
